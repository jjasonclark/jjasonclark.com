      <description>Most of the guides I find on how to install [Node.js][1] on Ubuntu are not about installing the currently released version, instead they focus on installing the latest development release. I think this is the case because they assume the reader is familiar with doing software installs on unix from source. I&#39;m coming from a Windows word were installing from the source is almost never done. This guide is for someone relatively new to unix installation or to Ubuntu server setup.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m currently working on improving my knowledge of UNIX networking. One of the common tasks for a server is acting as an NFS server. These are the steps I take on an Ubuntu 10.04 server to setup NFS.</description>
