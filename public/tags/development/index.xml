      <description>Iâ€™m a big fan of Bitcoin and its backing Blockchain protocol. I really do think it has the potential to allow for much broader uses of distributed control. Wish me luck finding a job in the Bitcoin world.</description>

      <title>Setting up a new Mac for Ruby development</title>

      <description>I recently switched how I was using one of my laptops. I wanted to make a clean break from what it was doing before, so I erased the hard drive and started from scratch. I&#39;ve done this a few times already and I always seem to forget a step. So this time I wrote down the steps so I could repeat them later. These are the steps I take to setup a Mac for Ruby development using Vim as the editor and MySql as the database. Of course there are a few other programs that I use while developing. The whole group, in my opinion, make for the most basic setup.</description>
