      <description>I finally did it! I joined the secure web. Thanks to Let’s Encrypt and Caddy, this blog is now served via HTTPS. Caddy makes using Let’s Encrypt a single line change in a config file. It could not get simpler than that. Here is how I converted from static hosting on Amazon’s S3 to a Digital Ocean instance running Caddy in a Docker container.</description>

I show how I created a Sinatra app with several nested Sinatra apps. And how I solved the issue with using a shared settings value from outer apps to the inner apps.</description>

      <description>Vagrant is an amazing application for helping you manage your virtual machines. Renewed development effort by it&#39;s creators has brought us many new features. Unfortunately this forced a change in the semantics of the Vagrantfile. Here is how to do the most basic upgrades to remove the warning messages Vagrant creates from using the older file type.</description>

      <title>Switching from attr_encrypted gem to attr_encryptor for better security</title>

      <guid>https://jjasonclark.com/switching_from_attr_encrypted_to_attr_encryptor/</guid>
      <description>At work we are using the attr_encrypted gem to encrypt some PII on our data before it hits the database. The gem supports using a strong key but this turns out to not be enough. A Github issue was created to address leaking of data caused by using the same initialization vector (IV) and salt for every value. The method used by the attr_encrypted gem to create the IV and salt values is vulnerable. Additionally the IV should also be processed with the CBC-MAC method. The attr_encryptor was created to fix these issues.</description>

      <description>I recently switched how I was using one of my laptops. I wanted to make a clean break from what it was doing before, so I erased the hard drive and started from scratch. I&#39;ve done this a few times already and I always seem to forget a step. So this time I wrote down the steps so I could repeat them later. These are the steps I take to setup a Mac for Ruby development using Vim as the editor and MySql as the database. Of course there are a few other programs that I use while developing. The whole group, in my opinion, make for the most basic setup.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to switch from developing for Rails 3.2.5 on Ruby 1.9.3 to working with Rails 2.3.5 on Ruby 1.8.7. The Rails version change wasn&#39;t that big of a deal, but the Ruby change was. Sometime between the release of 1.8.7 and 1.9.3 the supported GCC compiler changed. The newer compiler, the one I was on, had a breaking change making it not compatible with the older Ruby version. This meant that if I wanted to use Ruby 1.8.7 I was going to have to uninstall my current copy of Xcode and install an older version.</description>

      <title>Installing Node.js on Ubuntu 10.04 server</title>

      <guid>https://jjasonclark.com/installing-node-on-ubuntu-10.04/</guid>
      <description>Most of the guides I find on how to install [Node.js][1] on Ubuntu are not about installing the currently released version, instead they focus on installing the latest development release. I think this is the case because they assume the reader is familiar with doing software installs on unix from source. I&#39;m coming from a Windows word were installing from the source is almost never done. This guide is for someone relatively new to unix installation or to Ubuntu server setup.</description>

      <description>For those who, like me, are behind a corporate web proxy, setting up Node.js and using &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; can be a real pain. I thought that the web proxy settings would be like the rest of the unix world and require me to set the &lt;code&gt;HTTP_PROXY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;HTTPS_PROXY&lt;/code&gt; environment variables. Although I just cloned the Node repository from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/joyent/node&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; so they are already setup. What gives?</description>

I had done the research and all of the Internet services I used on the PC also worked for the Mac. So I waited until the Mac OS X Lion update came out to buy the newest version of the mini.</description>
