              I finally did it! I joined the secure web. Thanks to Let’s Encrypt and Caddy, this blog is now served via HTTPS. Caddy makes using Let’s Encrypt a single line change in a config file. It could not get simpler than that. Here is how I converted from static hosting on Amazon’s S3 to a Digital Ocean instance running Caddy in a Docker container.

            <p>
              At work we are using the attr_encrypted gem to encrypt some PII on our data before it hits the database. The gem supports using a strong key but this turns out to not be enough. A Github issue was created to address leaking of data caused by using the same initialization vector (IV) and salt for every value. The method used by the attr_encrypted gem to create the IV and salt values is vulnerable. Additionally the IV should also be processed with the CBC-MAC method. The attr_encryptor was created to fix these issues.

              I recently switched how I was using one of my laptops. I wanted to make a clean break from what it was doing before, so I erased the hard drive and started from scratch. I&#39;ve done this a few times already and I always seem to forget a step. So this time I wrote down the steps so I could repeat them later. These are the steps I take to setup a Mac for Ruby development using Vim as the editor and MySql as the database. Of course there are a few other programs that I use while developing. The whole group, in my opinion, make for the most basic setup.

              I recently needed to switch from developing for Rails 3.2.5 on Ruby 1.9.3 to working with Rails 2.3.5 on Ruby 1.8.7. The Rails version change wasn&#39;t that big of a deal, but the Ruby change was. Sometime between the release of 1.8.7 and 1.9.3 the supported GCC compiler changed. The newer compiler, the one I was on, had a breaking change making it not compatible with the older Ruby version. This meant that if I wanted to use Ruby 1.8.7 I was going to have to uninstall my current copy of Xcode and install an older version.

              Most of the guides I find on how to install [Node.js][1] on Ubuntu are not about installing the currently released version, instead they focus on installing the latest development release. I think this is the case because they assume the reader is familiar with doing software installs on unix from source. I&#39;m coming from a Windows word were installing from the source is almost never done. This guide is for someone relatively new to unix installation or to Ubuntu server setup.

              I was looking for a reason to play with Git more so I thought a good exercise would be to convert an open source project not already using Git. At the same time I put it on Github for easy access.
