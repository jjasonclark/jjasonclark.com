              I&#39;m a Vim user, but i&#39;m not 100% sold on it. I keep wanting to find an even better editor. I&#39;ve tried just about everything but nothing sticks. I&#39;m starting a new book on Lisp programming so it is time to try Emacs again. May this time it will stick.

              Getting settings to work in a Sinatra app that includes other Sinatra apps can be done a lot easier than you think using the Rack::Config middleware. I show how I created a Sinatra app with several nested Sinatra apps. And how I solved the issue with using a shared settings value from outer apps to the inner apps.

            <p>
              Vagrant is an amazing application for helping you manage your virtual machines. Renewed development effort by it&#39;s creators has brought us many new features. Unfortunately this forced a change in the semantics of the Vagrantfile. Here is how to do the most basic upgrades to remove the warning messages Vagrant creates from using the older file type.

            </h2>
            <p>
              At work we are using the attr_encrypted gem to encrypt some PII on our data before it hits the database. The gem supports using a strong key but this turns out to not be enough. A Github issue was created to address leaking of data caused by using the same initialization vector (IV) and salt for every value. The method used by the attr_encrypted gem to create the IV and salt values is vulnerable. Additionally the IV should also be processed with the CBC-MAC method. The attr_encryptor was created to fix these issues.

            <p>
              I recently switched how I was using one of my laptops. I wanted to make a clean break from what it was doing before, so I erased the hard drive and started from scratch. I&#39;ve done this a few times already and I always seem to forget a step. So this time I wrote down the steps so I could repeat them later. These are the steps I take to setup a Mac for Ruby development using Vim as the editor and MySql as the database. Of course there are a few other programs that I use while developing. The whole group, in my opinion, make for the most basic setup.
