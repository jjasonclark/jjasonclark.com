It could not get simpler than that. Here is how I converted from static hosting on Amazon’s S3 to a Digital Ocean instance running Caddy in a Docker container.

                At work we are using the attr_encrypted gem to encrypt some PII on our data before it hits the database. The gem supports using a strong key but this turns out to not be enough. A Github issue was created to address leaking of data caused by using the same initialization vector (IV) and salt for every value. The method used by the attr_encrypted gem to create the IV and salt values is vulnerable. Additionally the IV should also be processed with the CBC-MAC method. The attr_encryptor was created to fix these issues.

I&#39;ve done this a few times already and I always seem to forget a step. So this time I wrote down the steps so I could repeat them later. These are the steps I take to setup a Mac for Ruby development using Vim as the editor and MySql as the database. Of course there are a few other programs that I use while developing. The whole group, in my opinion, make for the most basic setup.

                I recently needed to switch from developing for Rails 3.2.5 on Ruby 1.9.3 to working with Rails 2.3.5 on Ruby 1.8.7. The Rails version change wasn&#39;t that big of a deal, but the Ruby change was. Sometime between the release of 1.8.7 and 1.9.3 the supported GCC compiler changed. The newer compiler, the one I was on, had a breaking change making it not compatible with the older Ruby version. This meant that if I wanted to use Ruby 1.8.7 I was going to have to uninstall my current copy of Xcode and install an older version.

                Most of the guides I find on how to install [Node.js][1] on Ubuntu are not about installing the currently released version, instead they focus on installing the latest development release. I think this is the case because they assume the reader is familiar with doing software installs on unix from source. I&#39;m coming from a Windows word were installing from the source is almost never done. This guide is for someone relatively new to unix installation or to Ubuntu server setup.

                The Any() extension method helps make much more efficient SQL queries. Use it and love it!
