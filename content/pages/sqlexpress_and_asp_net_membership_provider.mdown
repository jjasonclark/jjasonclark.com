# SQLExpress and ASP.Net membership provider

One of my favorite activities is to create a new project. Just saying "file, new project" gets me thinking about all the possibilities. Lately I've been trying to work on my web development skills so I've been creating a lot of new web applications in Visual Studio. In many cases I also need to have these projects use the normal ASP.Net membership provider. This is where the common problem comes in.

How do you setup ASP.Net membership with a SQLExpress database?

There are some great blog posts already out there that try to explain what to do. Lance's blog post "<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/lhunt/archive/2005/09/26/425966.aspx">Using ASPNET_RegSQL.exe with SQL Express databases in APP_DATA</a>" seems to be the best one. Unfortunately his suggestion doesn't work well for me. It all boils down to the command line arguments being a little off. I thought I would try to explain the command line arguments a bit better for this special case.

To start with take a look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229862.aspx">official command line reference</a> from Microsoft for the aspnet_regsql.exe tool.
