## Working on my Crusader title

<p>This week has flown by.&#160; I’ve had a bunch of good news and I’ve finally gotten a gadget for myself.&#160; Soon I’ll be able to blog from anywhere.</p>  <p>The good news is that my brother is coming up for a visit the same time Robert is. He even got on the same flight here. I’m really looking forward to seeing them both. And it is nice that Brent will be staying an additional day.</p>  <p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy Brent is coming, but it does suck that I have to take another day off for it. I really miss having paid days off. That’s just one of the new burdens with the new job situation.</p>  <p>Elizabeth and I have a full schedule of activates for us to do. We even went so far as to plan out what meals to cook. Every day should have enough stuff packed into it that we should all pass out really early each night.</p>  <p>In Warcraft I got the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2777">Champion of Darnassus</a> achievement.&#160; I finial finished the first of 5 championships I need to earn.&#160; After becoming champion of all the factions I can get the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2782">Champion of the Alliance</a> achievement for the Crusader title and access to the new content when patch 3.2 comes out.</p>  <p>Right now I’m working on the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2781">Champion of Stormwind</a> achievement.&#160; It was the next faction to the right from the one I started with.&#160; In hindsight I should have done <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2778">Champion of the Exodar</a> instead since it would mean I would have started on the left side of the circle and moved to the right.&#160; I’ll go for it next after Stormwind is done.</p>
