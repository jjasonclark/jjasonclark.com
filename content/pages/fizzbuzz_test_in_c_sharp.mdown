## FizzBuzz test in C#

I've been looking at developer job related web sites to see what kinds of "things" are being used in interviews. There are a few programmer challenges that people are using to weed out the less capable developers. In particular the one called <a href="http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/">FizzBuzz test</a> is quite amazing to me. It isn't the simplicity of the challenge that gets me it is the fact that so many cannot write it during the interview. I would assume that any level of developer can easily complete this code. Although I keep seeing examples all over the web about how current <em>(2010)</em> job candidates cannot write it.

So, what the heck! Another example of how it can be done.

The challenge is to print all numbers from 1 to 100. When a number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz" instead. And when the number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz" instead. Lastly print "Fizz-Buzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
void Main()
{
    Console.WriteLine(
        Enumerable.Range(1, 100)
            .Aggregate(new StringBuilder(), (sb, i) =&gt; sb.AppendLine(fizzBuzz(i)))
            .ToString());
}

string fizzBuzz(int i)
{
    var isRule3 = i % 3 == 0;
    var isRule5 = i % 5 == 0;

    if(isRule3 &amp;&amp; isRule5) return &quot;Fizz-Buzz&quot;;
    if(isRule3) return &quot;Fizz&quot;;
    if(isRule5) return &quot;Buzz&quot;;
    return i.ToString();
}
[/sourcecode]
