## Fizz-buzz rehash

While moving my blog content from site to site my post on Fizz-buzz caught my eye again. I thought I would post another implementation that was even more complex (read don't use in your interview)

This one uses the iterator pattern and the null coalescing operator for added complexity.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
void Main()
{
	Console.WriteLine(string.Join(&quot;, &quot;, FizzBuzz().Take(100).ToArray()));
}

string[,] fbLogic = new string[2, 2]
{
	{&quot;Fizz-Buzz&quot;, &quot;Fizz&quot; },
	{&quot;Buzz&quot;, null }
};

IEnumerable FizzBuzz()
{
	for (int i = 1; true; ++i)
	{
		yield return fbLogic[i % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1, i % 5 == 0 ? 0 : 1] ?? i.ToString();
	}
}
[/sourcecode]
