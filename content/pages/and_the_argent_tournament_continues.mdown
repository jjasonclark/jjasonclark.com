## And the Argent Tournament continues

Still working on the Argent Tournament quest lines. Now that I have access to all of the dailies I’m finding I’m compelled to complete them all. There are the standard 4 dailies to get the Crusader title. And now I’m also doing the 4 from the other tent with the Black Knight quest line. And since it is on the way I also do the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=13627">Jack Me Some Lumber</a> quest. Unfortunately for me once I turn it in, normally the last one I turn in, I have to pick up <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=13681">A Chip Off the Ulduar Block</a> since its right there and so easy to complete. All and all this is taking me about an hour and a half per day. Honestly don’t know how many more days I can keep it up. Thankfully my friends are coming into town and I’ll be taking about 6 days off from WoW.

Anyhow, the work has been paying off. I turned in 25 <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44990">Champion’s Seals</a> and got <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45078">Dagger of Lunar Purity</a>. As far as I can tell it is the best 1 hander I can get until Naxx or better raid comes along. Going to have to get a really nice enchant for it. I should also complete the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2781">Champion of Stormwind</a> achievement today. I also completed the Black Knight quest line to get <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2773">It's Just a Flesh Wound</a>. And lastly I also got my last needed faction for <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2836">Lance a Lot</a>. I’m really racking up the achievements from the Argent Tournament.
