I'm a [switcher](http://youtu.be/Hk8hxjpnUiw)! I switched from PC to Mac. It started when I wanted to replace the computer I use to run my TV. I picked the
[Mac Mini](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jasclasblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6) because of it's size. I had done the research and all of the Internet services I used on the PC also worked for the Mac. So I waited until the Mac OS X Lion update came out to buy the newest version of the mini.

In addition to the media streaming I also started using the mini for iTunes and iPhoto. I cannot stand iTunes on Windows, but on the Mac is it much better. This of course led me to using the mini for more and more things. I am super happy with my purchase. So much so that I have purchased a [MacBook Air](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWHZP4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jasclasblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B005CWHZP4). It arrived today and I'm very excited.

I'm actually replacing my "main use" computer for the Mac. I'm a full on switcher now.
