I’m a big fan of Bitcoin and its backing Blockchain protocol. I really do think it has the potential to allow for much broader uses of distributed control. Personally I would love to see voting revolutionized by the Blockchain. In the mean time I would happy to just support the new economy by working in it or getting paid in it.

The price of Bitcoin has been dropping a lot recently, but I think I will keep it in mind for my next consulting job anyway. I’m not a crypto expert. Although there are plenty of software to be written that doesn’t need a Phd to write. Heck, I might find someone working on a voting system.

Wish me luck finding a job in the Bitcoin world.
